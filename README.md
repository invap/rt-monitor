# The Runtime Monitor

This project contains an implementation of a Runtime Monitoring tool (RM). The rationale behind this tool is that it provides runtime verification capabilities provided it is given:
1. an analysis framework specification (see Section [Specification language for describing the analysis framework](#specification-language-for-describing-the-analysis-framework) for a complete description of the specification language and the file format)
2. an [event report file](#event-report-file)

The reader is pointed to Section [Event language for monitoring](#event-language-for-monitoring) for a complete description of the event language and also consider reading:
 
- Section [Relevant information about the implementation](https://github.com/invap/rt-reporter/blob/main/README.md#relevant-information-about-the-implementation) of [The Runtime Reporter](https://github.com/invap/rt-reporter/) project (an example runtime reporter (RR) that produces event log files that can be processed by the RM), and 
- Section [Implementation of the C reporter API](https://github.com/invap/c-reporter-api/blob/main/README.md#implementation-of-the-reporter-api) of the [C reporter API](https://github.com/invap/c-reporter-api/) project (a library that can be used to produce an instrumented version of the source code of the software under test (SUT), which can later be processed by the RR for producing an event log file). Alternatively, Section [Implementation of the Rust reporter API](https://github.com/clpombo/rust-reporter-api/blob/master/README.md#implementation-of-the-reporter-api) of the [Rust reporter API](https://github.com/clpombo/rust-reporter-api/)

The analysis process consists of checking if an appropriate set of event reports obtained from an execution of the SUT, through the application of a runtime reporter tool (RR) (for example, [The Runtime Reporter](https://github.com/invap/rt-reporter "The Runtime Reporter") and [The DAP-supported Runtime Reporter](https://github.com/invap/dap-rt-reporter "The DAP-supported Runtime Reporter")), satisfy the desired properties formalized in the analysis framework specification. If it does, the verification is considered to be *SUCCESSFUL*, and if it does not, is considered to be *UNSUCCESSFUL* exposing an execution trace of the SUT that does not behave as prescribed by the specification.

## Installation
In this section we will review relevant aspects of how to setup this project, both for developing new features for the RM, and for using it in the runtime verification of other software artifacts.

### Base Python installation

1. Python v.3.12+ (https://www.python.org/)
2. PIP v.24.3.1+ (https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)
3. Setup tools v.75.3.0+ / Poetry v.2.1.1+ (https://python-poetry.org)


### Setting up a Python virtual environment
To create a Python virtual environment, follow these steps:

1. **Open a terminal or command prompt:**
Start by opening your terminal (on MacOS or Linux) or Command Prompt/PowerShell (on Windows).

2. **Navigate to your project directory:**
If you have a specific directory for your project, navigate to it using the cd command:
```bash
cd path/to/your/project
```
3. **Create a Python virtual environment:**
Run one of the following commands, depending on your version of Python:
	- For Python 3.3 and newer:
	```bash
	python -m venv env
	```
	Replace `env` with whatever name you'd like for your environment folder (common names include venv, .venv, or env).
	- For Older Versions (Python 2):
		- You may need to install `virtualenv` first if you're using Python 2:
		```bash
		pip install virtualenv
		```
		- Then, create the virtual environment with:
		```bash
		virtualenv env
		```
4. **Activate the virtual environment:**
To activate the virtual environment, use one of the following commands based on your operating system:
	- On Mac OS and Linux:
	```bash
	source env/bin/activate
	```
	- On Windows:
	```bash
	.\env\Scripts\activate
	```
	Once activated, you’ll see the environment name in parentheses at the beginning of your command prompt.
5. **Install packages in the virtual environment:**
With the environment activated, you can now install packages using `pip`, and they’ll be isolated to this environment.
```bash
pip install package_name
```
Perform this command for each of the packages required replacing `package_name` with the name of each package in the file [`requirements.txt`](https://github.com/invap/rt-monitor/blob/main/requirements.txt) or just run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- **Content of [`requirements.txt`](https://github.com/invap/rt-monitor/blob/main/requirements.txt):**
- black~=24.10.0
- boto~=2.49.0
- igraph~=0.11.6
- mpmath~=1.3.0

7. **Do something with RR...**
8. **Deactivate the virtual environment:**
To exit the virtual environment, simply type:
```bash
deactivate
```
Your environment will remain in the project folder for you to reactivate as needed.

### Setting up the project using Poetry
This section provide instructions for setting up the project using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org)
1. **Install Poetry:** find instructions for your system [here](https://python-poetry.org) 
2. **Add [`pyproject.toml`](https://github.com/invap/rt-monitor/blob/main/pyproject.toml):** the content of the `pyproject.toml` file needed for setting up the project using poetry is shown below.
```toml
[tool.poetry]

z3-solver = "~=4.13.0.0"

[build-system]
requires = ["poetry-core>=1.0.0"]
build-backend = "poetry.core.masonry.api"
```
3. **Install the project:** To install the Python project using Poetry, navigate to the directory where the project is and run:
   ```bash	
   poetry install
   ```
3. **Activate the virtual environment**: To activate the virtual environment created by the previous command run:
   ```bash
   poetry env use [your_python_command]
   poetry env activate
   ```
this will ensure you are using the right Python virtual machine and then, activate the virtual environment.


### Using the project with docker
1. **Build the image:**
    ```bash
    docker build . -t rt-reporter-env
    ```
2. **Run the container:**
	```bash
	docker run -it -v$PWD:/home/workspace rt-reporter-env
	```
3. **Do something with RR...**


### Linting Python code (with Black)
A linter in Python is a tool that analyzes your code for potential errors, code quality issues, and stylistic inconsistencies. Linters help enforce a consistent code style and identify common programming mistakes, which can improve the readability and maintainability of your code. They’re especially useful in team environments to maintain coding standards.

Though primarily an auto-formatter, `Black` enforces a consistent code style and handles many linting issues by reformatting your code directly.

1. **Activate the virtual environment in your project directory:**
2. **Run linter (black):**
	- For correcting the code:
	```bash
	black .
	```
	- For checking but not correcting the code:
	```bash
	black . --check
	```

### Perform regression testing
Tu run the unit tests of the project use the command `python -m unittest discover -s . -t .`.

When executed, it performs Python unit tests with the `unittest` module, utilizing the `discover` feature to automatically find and execute test files.
- `python -m unittest`:
Runs the `unittest` module as a script. This is a built-in Python module used for testing. When called with `-m`, it allows you to execute tests directly from the command line.
- `discover`:
Tells `unittest` to search for test files automatically. This is useful when you have many test files, as it eliminates the need to specify each test file manually. By default, `unittest` discover will look for files that start with "test" (e.g., `test_example.py`).
- `-s .`:
The `-s` option specifies the start directory for test discovery.
Here, `.` means the current directory, so `unittest` will start looking for tests in the current directory and its subdirectories.
- `-t .`:
The `-t` option sets the top-level directory of the project.
Here, `.` also indicates the current directory. This is mainly useful when the start directory (`-s`) is different from the project's root. For simple projects, the start directory and top-level directory are often the same.

**In summary, this command tells Python’s `unittest` module to:**
Look in the current directory (`-s .`) for any test files that match the naming pattern `test*.py`.
Run all the tests it finds, starting from the current directory (`-t .`) and treating it as the top-level directory.


### Build the application as a library with poetry
To build a package from the Python project follow these steps:
Now that your configuration files are set, you can build the package using poetry running the build command in the root directory of the project:
```bash
poetry build
```
This will create two files in a new `dist` directory:
- A source distribution: [rt_reporter-0.1.0.tar.gz](https://github.com/invap/rt-reporter/blob/main/dist/rt_reporter-0.1.0.tar.gz)
- A wheel distribution: [rt_reporter-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl](https://github.com/invap/rt-reporter/blob/main/dist/rt_reporter-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl)


### Build the application as a library with setuptools
To build a package from the Python project follow these steps:

1. **The `setup.py` file:**
the [`setup.py`](https://github.com/invap/rt-monitor/blob/main/setup.py) file is the main configuration file for packaging in Python. See the content of the file below:
```python
from setuptools import setup, find_packages


def read_requirements(file):
    with open(file, 'r') as f:
        return f.read().splitlines()


setup(
    name="rt-monitor",
    version="0.1.0",
    author="Carlos Gustavo Lopez Pombo",
    author_email="clpombo@gmail.com",
    description="An implementation of a runtime monitor.",
    long_description=open("README.md").read(),
    long_description_content_type="text/markdown",
    url="https://github.com/invap/rt-monitor/",
    packages=find_packages(),
    install_requires=read_requirements("./requirements.txt"),
    classifiers=[
        "Development status :: 4 - Beta",
        "Intended Audience :: Developers",
        "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.12",
        "License :: OSI Approved :: GNU Affero General Public License v3 or later",
        "Operating System :: OS Independent",
    ],
    python_requires='>=3.12',
)
```
2. **Add `pyproject.toml` (Optional but Recommended):** 
the content of the `pyproject.toml` file for building the project using setuptools is shown below:
```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools", "wheel"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"
```
This configuration tells Python to use `setuptools` and `wheel` for building the package.
3. **Build the package:**
Now that your configuration files are set, you can build the package using setuptools and wheel.
- Install the necessary tools (if not already installed):
```bash
pip install setuptools wheel
```
- Run the build command in the root directory (where setup.py is located):
```bash
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```
This will create two files in a new dist/ directory:
- A source distribution: [rt_monitor-0.1.0.tar.gz](https://github.com/invap/rt-monitor/blob/main/dist/rt_reporter-0.1.0.tar.gz)
- A wheel distribution: [rt_monitor-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl](https://github.com/invap/rt-monitor/blob/main/dist/rt_reporter-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl)


### Install the application as a library locally
Follow the steps below for installing the RR as a local library:
1. **Build the application as a library:**
Follow the steps in Section [Build the application as a library](#build-the-application-as-a-library)
2. **Install the package locally:** 
Use the command `pip install dist/rt_reporter-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl`.

### Distribute the application as a library
Follow the steps below for distributing the RR as a library in PyPI:
1. **Build the application as a library:**
Follow the steps in Section [Build the application as a library](#build-the-application-as-a-library)
2. **Upload the package to PyPI:**
If you want to make your package publicly available, you can upload it to the Python Package Index (PyPI).
	- Install twine (a tool for uploading packages):
	```bash
	pip install twine
	```
	- Upload the package:
	```bash
	twine upload dist/*
	```
	This command will prompt you to enter your PyPI credentials. Once uploaded, others can install your package with `pip install your-package-name`.


## The Runtime Monitor architecture
[Figure 1](#rt-monitor-architecture) shows a high level view of the architecture of the RM. In it, we highlight the most relevant components and how

  <figcaption style="font-style: italic;"><b>Figure 1</b>: The Runtime Monitor architecture.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

As we mentioned in the introduction, the `Runtime Monitor` takes two inputs: **1)** a *Set of event reports* obtained from a concrete execution of the `Software under Test` by an `Event reporter` (see Section [Event reports map file](#event-reports-map-file) for details about the input file format), and **2)** an *Analysis framework* consisting of: **a)** a formalization of the Structured Sequential Process (SSP) (see Section [Specification language for describing the analysis framework](#specification-language-for-describing-the-analysis-framework) for details about the language for describing SPP and the input file format) and **b)** a set of implementations of digital twins for the components used by the SUT (see Section [Implementation of digital twins for monitoring software components](#implementation-of-digital-twins-for-monitoring-software-components) for understanding the importance of digital twins in the verification of executions). Given that input, the `Analyzer` uses de `Event processor` to crawl the event reports whose events are decoded by the `Event decoder` and then executed producing: **1)** changes in the *Execution's state*, **2)** the execution of a function associated to a specific component through the `Components' command dispatcher` which, in turn, will produce the corresponding changes in the *Component state*, or **3)** changes in the current location (task or checkpoint) in the traversing of the SSP.

Processing events associated with the traversing of the SSP triggers the analysis of properties associated to specific points in the SSP. In this way, an event of type `task_started` will result in checking that the preconditions of the task mentioned in the event are true in the current state, analogously, an event of type `task_finished` will result in checking that the postconditions of the task are true, finally, an event of type `checkpoint_reached` will result in checking that the properties associated to that point in the SSP are true.

Each property is declared to be of a certain type which requires a purpose specific `Specification builder` specific solvers, for example, [The Z3 Theorem prover](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/z3-3/) for SMT2 properties, [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html) for properties that require the use of a Computer Algebra System (CAS), or a Python program to solve simple arithmetic.


## Event language for monitoring
From the six different types of events, `timed_event`, `state_event`, `process_event`, `component_event`.

- `timed_event`: the event is expected to have the format `[timestamp],timed_event,[event]` in the file corresponding to the main event report file. `[event]` provide details of the timed event reported and has the shape `[clock action],[clock variable]`, where `[clock action]` is in the set {`clock_start`, `clock_pause`, `clock_resume`, `clock_reset`} and `[clock variable]` is the name of a free clock variable occurring in any property of the SSP (see Section [Syntax for writing properties](#syntax-for-writing-properties "Syntax for writing properties"),
- `state_event`: the event is expected to have the format `[timestamp],state_event,[event]` in the file corresponding to the main event report file. `[event]` provide details of the state event reported and has the shape `variable_value_assigned,[variable name],[value]` where `[variable name]` is the name of a free state variable occurring in any property of the structured sequential process (see Section [Syntax for writing properties](#syntax-for-writing-properties "Syntax for writing properties") for details on the language for writing properties of structured sequential processes),
- `process_event`: the event is expected to have the format `[timestamp],process_event,[event]` in the file corresponding to the main event report file. `[event]` provide details of the process event reported and has the shape `task_started,[name]`, `task_finished,[name]` or `checkpoint_reached,[name]`, where `[name]` is a unique identifier corresponding to a task o checkpoint, respectively, in the structured sequential process (see Section [Structured Sequential Process](#structured-sequential-process "Structured Sequential Process") for details on the language for declaring structured sequential processes),
- `component_event`: the event is expected to have the format `[timestamp],component_event,[event]` in the file corresponding to the main event report file. `[event]` provide details of the component event reported and has the shape `[component name],[function name],[parameter list]`, where `[component name]` is a unique identifier corresponding to a component declared in the specification of the analysis framework (see Section [Specification language for describing the analysis framework](https://github.com/invap/rt-monitor/blob/main/README.md#specification-language-for-describing-the-analysis-framework "Specification language for describing the analysis framework") for details on the language for specifying the analysis framework), `[function name]` is the name of a function implemented by the component, `[parameter list]` is the list of parameters required by the function `[function name]`, separated by commas, see for example the entries resulting from the code fragment from [Line 70](https://github.com/invap/rt-monitor-example-app/blob/main/buggy%20app/main.c#L70) to [Line 76](https://github.com/invap/rt-monitor-example-app/blob/main/buggy%20app/main.c#L76) of the function [`main`](https://github.com/invap/rt-monitor-example-app/blob/main/buggy%20app/main.c#L17), in the file [`main.c`](https://github.com/invap/rt-monitor-example-app/blob/main/buggy%20app/main.c), where the invocation of function `sample` is followed by a code fragment reporting a component event:
```c
value = sample ();
// [ INSTRUMENTACION: Component event. ]
pause(&reporting_clk);
sprintf(str, "adc,sample,%d",value);
report(component_event,str);
resume(&reporting_clk);
//
```


## Specification language for describing the analysis framework
An *Analysis framework* consists of: **a)** a formalization of the SSP and **b)** a set of implementations of digital twins for the components used by the SUT (see Section [Implementation of digital twins for monitoring software components](#implementation-of-digital-twins-for-monitoring-software-components) for understanding the importance of digital twins in the verification of executions).

### Syntax for writing SSPs
Structured sequential processes are defined inductively by the following grammar in Backus–Naur form (BNF):
```bnf
        <SSP> ::= task (<ID>, <FORMULAE>, <FORMULAE>, <CHECKPOINTS>) | 
                  checkpoint (<ID>, <FORMULAE>) | 
                  <SSP> + <SSP> | 
                  <SSP> ; <SSP> | 
                  <SSP>* | 
                  <SSP>w
<CHECKPOINTS> ::= <CHECKPOINT> | <CHECKPOINT> <CHECKPOINTS>
<FORMULAE>    ::= <FORMULA> | <FORMULA> <FORMULAE>
<FORMULA>     ::= <SMT2-FORMULA> | <PY-FORMULA> | <SYMPY-FORMULA>
         <ID> ::= <CHAR> | <ID><CHAR>
       <CHAR> ::= <SYMBOL> | <LETTER> | <DIGIT>
<LETTER>      ::= "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F" | "G" | "H" | "I" | "J" | "K" | "L" | "M" | "N" | "O" | "P" | "Q" | "R" | "S" | "T" | "U" | "V" | "W" | "X" | "Y" | "Z" | "a" | "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f" | "g" | "h" | "i" | "j" | "k" | "l" | "m" | "n" | "o" | "p" | "q" | "r" | "s" | "t" | "u" | "v" | "w" | "x" | "y" | "z"
      <DIGIT> ::= "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9"
     <SYMBOL> ::= "|" | "!" | "#" | "$" | "%" | "&" | "(" | ")" | "*" | "+" | "," | "-" | "." | "/" | ":" | ";" | ">" | "=" | "<" | "?" | "@" | "[" | "\" | "]" | "^" | "_" | "`" | "{" | "}" | "~"
```

Alternatively, one can think of an SSP as a directed graph whose nodes are labeled either with a task of the form `task (<ID>, <FORMULAE>, <FORMULAE>, <CHECKPOINTS>)` or with a checkpoint of the form `checkpoint (<ID>, <FORMULAE>)`.

### Syntax for writing properties
Formulae come in different flavours depending on the tool required to solve its satisfiability. There are three formula typeseach of which corresponds to one of the non-terminal symbols of the grammar shown above:

- SMT formulae (corresponding to the non-terminal symbols `<SMT2-FORMULA>`):
- Simple arithmetic based formulae (corresponding to the non-terminal symbols `<PY-FORMULA>`):
- Complex mathematical formulae (corresponding to the non-terminal symbols `<SYMPY-FORMULA>`): this type of formular require a CAS




### Input format
By default, the files are expected to be found in the location designated by the attribute `working_directory`. If such attribute is not present, then the path of the analysis framework specification is used instead. Nonetheless, if the `file` attribute of a property is specifies by a string starting with `/` of `.`, the path section of the value of the attribute (i.e., the substring starting at position 0 and ending right before the last occurrence of `/`) overrides the default.

Components have a general path and specific paths for components. If the specific path is not preset, the general one is used. If both are missing the component is assumed to be in the directory from with the tool was launched ".".

## The runtime monitoring process
We already gave a high level view of the verification process in Section [The Runtime Monitor architecture](#the-untime-onitor-architecture). Now we will dive into de process in a more structured and detailed way.

As we mentioned before the RM has to be provided: **1)** a *Set of event reports* obtained from a concrete execution of the `Software under Test` by an `Event reporter` (see Section [Event reports map file](#event-reports-map-file) for details about the input file format), and **2)** an *Analysis framework* consisting of: **a)** a formalization of the Structured Sequential Process (SSP) (see Section [Specification language for describing the analysis framework](#specification-language-for-describing-the-analysis-framework) for details about the language for describing SPP and the input file format) and **b)** a set of implementations of digital twins for the components used by the SUT (see Section [Implementation of digital twins for monitoring software components](#implementation-of-digital-twins-for-monitoring-software-components) for understanding the importance of digital twins in the verification of executions).

The command line interface for the RR is very simple, it is invoked by typing `python rt-monitor [SUT full path]` and it will run the SUT producing the corresponding event log files in the same location where the SUT is, according to the indicated in `[SUT full path]`.

The interface keeps itself listening to the keyboard; pressing the letter `s` stops the execution of the SUT, closes the event log files and exits the command line interface of the RR.

An alternative implementation for Windows-based systems can be developed using `msvcrt`.

## Troubleshooting
In Mac OS the execution of the RR migth output the message "This process is not trusted! Input event monitoring will not be possible until it is added to accessibility clients.". This happens when an application attempts to monitor keyboard or mouse input without having the necessary permissions because Mac OS restricts access to certain types of input monitoring for security and privacy reasons. To solve it you need to grant accessibility permissions to the application running the program (e.g., Terminal, iTerm2, or a Python IDE). Here’s how:
1. Open System Preferences:
	- Go to **Apple menu** --> **System Preferences** --> **Security & Privacy**.
2. Go to Accessibility Settings:
	- In the **Privacy** tab, select **Accessibility** from the list on the left.
3. Add Your Application:
	- If you are running the RR from **Terminal**, **iTerm2**, or a specific **IDE** (like PyCharm or VS Code), you will need to add that application to the list of allowed applications.
	- Click the **lock icon** at the bottom left and enter your password to make changes.
	- Then, click the `+` button, navigate to the application (e.g., Terminal or Python IDE), and add it to the list.
4. Restart the Application:
	- After adding it to the Accessibility list, restart the application to apply the new permissions.
Once you’ve done this, the message should go away, and pynput should be able to detect keyboard and mouse events properly.
